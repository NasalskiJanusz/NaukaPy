# The region that a variable is recognized
# A variable is only available from inside the region it is created.
# A global and locally scoped versions of a variable can be created


# last_name = 'Nasalski'
# def display_name():
#     name = "Janek"      # local scope (available only inside this function)
#     print(name)         # if you try to print variable "name" outside func, it wont work
#
# # in the same time global variable are available inside and outside functions:
#
# def display_last_name():
#     name = last_name
#     print(name)

# also, it's possible to have 2 or more variables with the same name
# in that case 1. variable must be global and the rest of them must be local (in func)
